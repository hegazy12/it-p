<h1 class="title">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<br>
<h1 class="header">1. Ordering</h1>
<h1 class="subheader">How do I track my order?</h1>
<h1 class="text">We will email you as items in your order ship, or if there are updates on the status of your order.
If you have a Nordstrom.com profile, sign in to your account. You'll see which purchases are on the way and get to the shipment tracking updates. 
If you don't have an account, find your order number, then go to order information and enter it.
For international orders, please call 1.319.846.4140 or check your order history on Borderfree.</h1>
<br><br>
<h1 class="subheader">How do I know if ordering online is secure?</h1>
<h1 class="text">To help determine if your connection is secure, look at the status bar of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) should be active, which helps to protect the transmission of information through the website. You should also verify that the URL for the page you are on includes "https" at the beginning. Most browsers offer additional security alerts as well.</h1>
<br><br>
<h1 class="subheader">What happens when my item is backordered?</h1>
<h1 class="text">Items that aren't available to ship when an order is placed are on backorder and will ship at a later date. We'll provide you with an approximate ship date when you add the item to your bag and when you check out. Backorder ship dates are approximate, and we'll email you if the date changes. Please note that, while your credit card will be authorized on the date you place your order, you will not be charged until the item ships.</h1>
<br><br>
<h1 class="subheader">Can I cancel an order?</h1>
<h1 class="text">You can request to cancel your order within a short time period after placing your order. To cancel your order, sign in to your account, find the order in your purchases, click "Details" and then click "Cancel Order" to start the request process. If the "Cancel Order" button is disabled, the window to cancel has passed and your order is not eligible for cancellation. We're unable to cancel an order beyond this time period.
Your payment method will not be charged if we are able to cancel your order. If we're unable to cancel your order, your payment method will be charged and your items will be shipped to you. We always have free returns by mail and in store.</h1>
<br><br>
<h1 class="subheader">When will I receive my refund?</h1>
<h1 class="text">All refunds will be credited to your original form of payment or a Nordstrom Gift Card.
If you return an item to a Nordstrom store, the refunded amount will be applied to your credit card. Depending on your financial institution, you may see that refund within 3–5 business days. If you return an item to us by U.S. mail, we usually receive it within 10–14 business days. Once the item is received, we will process your refund. Depending on your financial institution, you may see that refund on your credit card within 3–5 business days.
If you’re returning a gift, you’ll receive a Gift Card with the credited amount.
If you paid with a Gift Card, you’ll receive an eGift Card via email with the credited amount.
For faster returns, bring your return items to any Nordstrom store. Find a store.</h1>

You can return items by mail or at any Nordstrom store. We now accept returns of Nordstrom, Nordstrom.com and Nordstrom.ca merchandise at Nordstrom Rack locations. Boutique returns must be processed at the store where they were originally purchased.</h1>
<br><br>
<h1 class="subheader">How do I return items by mail?</h1>
<h1 class="text">If you have an account or an order number, you can start your return now. If you don't have an account or you're missing order information, you can start your return here.

We handle returns on a case-by-case basis with the ultimate goal of making our customers happy. We stand behind our goods and services and want customers to be satisfied with them. We'll always do our best to take care of customers—our philosophy is to deal with them fairly and reasonably. We have long believed that when we treat our customers fairly, they in turn are fair with us. We apply refunds to the tender used to purchase the items being returned. If we choose to provide a refund and no record of sale is available, we'll ask for personal identification and a refund will be provided at the current price on a Nordstrom Gift Card.</h1>
